# Interactive-Hangman-Game-with-Python-Tkinter

An interactive Hangman 🎮 game developed with Python and Tkinter. Features include:

Single-player mode with word categories and 💡 hints.  
Multiplayer mode for two players.    
🏆 Leaderboard to track player scores.  
Simple menu for navigation and game options.  
Clean and user-friendly graphical interface.  

This project illustrates the application of key Python programming concepts—including data structures, control flow, functions, file I/O, and string manipulation—within the development of a graphical Hangman game using Tkinter. It serves as a practical example of how these fundamental Python features can be combined to create a functional and interactive application.
